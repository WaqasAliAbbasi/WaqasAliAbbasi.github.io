## Summary

Chairman is a very cheap solution to a big problem university students face. By analyzing camera feeds in learning spaces, chairman can help find empty seats closest to a student on a university campus.

The AI model is a Keras implementation of RetinaNet object detection. It's a very accurate R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) approach.
