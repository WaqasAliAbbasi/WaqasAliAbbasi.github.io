DragonSearch is an academic research engine for financial researchers developed with accuracy and speed in time:

- Instead of putting in a keyword and sorting through the results, the user can choose what authors, topics and papers they like and the results will change based on the feedback.
- We build upon [G-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-index) by also taking into account published date of papers.
- The entire search is done in a single tab without having to open new tabs. The preview sidebar helps explore all results easily.
- Can easily explore collaboration networks of authors.
- Whether you go deep or wide in your search, DragonSearch helps keep everything organized
